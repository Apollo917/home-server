# Cloudflare

Our last step is to buy and set up a domain name via Cloudflare. It sounds easy, and it is, but there may be a few pitfalls. So let's walk through this process together.

I am using [**Cloudflare**](https://www.cloudflare.com/) as a service that handles my domain name and it's security. It has many features, like DDoS attack protection, auto SSL certificate generation, and more.<br>
But need to be mentioned one of the core features - request proxying. This feature hides your IP address when somebody accesses your home server services by the domain name.

üëÄ Check out [Resources](#resources) section for more info and guides

## Purchasing a domain name

By buying your domain name, you can generate fully valid and up-to-date SSL certificates is better. To have a handy way to access your home server services from the Internet.

In the current setup, I've purchased my domain name on [GoDaddy](https://www.godaddy.com/uk-ua). Of course, you can use another domain vendor, for example, **Cloudflare**. Just make sure that it supports **domain transfer** to Cloudflare.
Also, not all TLDs (Top-level domains) are supported by Cloudflare, so check if a domain name you want to buy is backed by Cloudflare by the link below.

## Transferring a domain on Cloudflare

**Note**

**‚úé** Giving domain name renewal control to Cloudflare is an optional step. You still be able to use all features described above without it.

**‚úé** After a successful DNS control transfer to Cloudflare, you must set SSL/TLS encryption mode to **Full**.<br>
I had **Flexible** mode activated by default, and it caused a **Too Many Redirects** error when I was trying to access my home server services from the Internet.

## Mapping public IP address with your domain name

### Static IP address

If you are the lucky owner of a static IP address, you just need to map it with your domain name via **DNS** **A** record on a Cloudflare **Websites** -> **Your domain name** -> **DNS** -> **Records** settings section. And that's it. You are ready to go!

### Dynamic IP address

Unfortunately, by default, ISPs (Internet Service Providers) rarely give a static IP address to their clients.<br>
More likely, you have a **dynamic** IP address, which means, that it changes occasionally. So you need to keep **A** **DNS** record IP address up-to-date. You can use **DDNS** (Dynamic DNS) for that purpose.
Down below, you can find links to tutorials about how to set up **DDNS** with **Cloudflare**.

- [DDNS on a Raspberry Pi using the Cloudflare API (Dynamic DNS)](https://youtu.be/rI-XxnyWFnM)

‚ö†Ô∏èBut there might be a pitfall with dynamic IP addresses. In some cases, it is **impossible** to use it to reach out to your home server, even if it is up-to-date. It could be caused by your ISP restrictions, etc.<br>
In this case, you have a few options:

- Buy a static IP address (which I did)
- **Cloudflare Tunnel**, which will be described in a following section

### Cloudflare Tunnel

**Cloudflare Tunnel** is a mighty service but not a silver bullet. It has some limitations as well. More info you will find in the following video:
